Align Timestamps
================
Computes a transformation from probe sample indices to times on the experiment master clock, then maps zero or more timestamp 
arrays through that transform.


Running
-------
```
python -m ecephys_etl.modules.align_timestamps --input_json <path to input json> --output_json <path to output json>
```
See the schema file for detailed information about input json contents.


Input data
----------
- Sync h5 : Contains information about barcode pulses assessed on the master clock
- For each probe
    - barcode channel states file: lists rising and falling edges on the probe's barcode line
    - barcode timestamps file: lists probe samples at which rising and falling edges were detected
    - mappable timestamp files: Will be transformed to the master clock. An example would be a file listing timestamps of detected spikes.



Output data
-----------
Each mappable file for each probe is aligned and written out. Additionally, the transform is written into the output json.
